##RULES OF DIV DODGE:

  - Navigate your mouse cursor through the level without touching any of the obstacles.
  - Your cursor is allowed to touch an object in motion if you remain still as it passes over the cursor.

##GAME STRUCTURE:

  The game uses the 'onMouseOver' method using JQuery which hides all game elements when the cursor touches them, 
  forcing the player to start the level over.
 
  Animations and stylings use only native css, without any external libraries.
 
  Currently, the game is compatible with Safari, Chrome, and Opera.
 
##FUTURE ADDITIONS

  1. Add difficulty settings which will change the level design as well as the speed of moving obstacles.
  2. Add more levels and more bosses.
  3. Overhaul the story structure to be slightly less ridiculous.

  Spencer Lewis for level 3 boss character.
  
  David Smith for level 3 idea.
